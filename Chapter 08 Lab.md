6. Using the cmdlet from task 5, display all the times in the directory of your choice. Then extend the expression to sort the list by the time the items were created and display only the filename(s) and the date created. Rememeber that the column headers shown in a command's default output aren't necessarily the real property names---you'll need to look up the real property names to be sure.<br>

7. Repeat task 6, but this time sort the items by the last write time; then display the filename, creation tme, and the last write time. Save this in a CSV file and an HTML file.<br>
